## BuddyPress Group Calendar lets group members and moderators create and manage group calendars.

Display Events in a group calendar, as well as globally across the site. You've got some fantastic groups going on your BuddyPress site, and everyone wants to hook up, or plan a get together on Skype, or share dates of upcoming gigs or markets or events or exams.... Congratulations, your site is a success and now you need a group calendar!

### Organize group activities and events

The BuddyPress Group Calendar plugin offers the ability for groups to coordinate and organize events. There are unlimited uses for this functionality, including practices, festivals, performance schedules, business promotions, networking, learning management systems, markets, corporate events, etc.

 Seamless integration

 While creating new events, the user can see upcoming events that are scheduled for that specific group, as well as scroll ahead by month or year. Past events can be left on the calendar or users can delete them. This helps keep your group on track without double-booking.

### Promote events network-wide

This is not simply a calendar, but it offers event planning capabilities and the option to promote events on the front page of the social network using the Single Group Event widget. Non-group members can see the events scheduled and may elect to become linked up with the group simply because they are interested in the promoted event.

 Single Group Events widget lets members monitor upcoming group events

 Group members will be able to check out all of the new events that are scheduled for the groups they participate in when they log in to your network using the User's Group Events widget.
